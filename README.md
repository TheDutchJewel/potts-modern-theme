# Potts Modern Theme for webtrees

Potts Modern is a standalone, responsive heritage theme for webtrees 2.2.x. It combines a dark teal navigation header, parchment-inspired cards, modern SVG icons and configurable accessibility and layout options.

This is a **beta release** intended for testing on non-production or well-backed-up webtrees sites.

## Version 1.1.0-beta.13

This release fixes the administration settings page when Potts Modern is not the active theme. It also includes the Historical Facts compatibility and header improvements from beta.12.

## Features

- Responsive desktop, tablet and mobile layouts
- Modern icon-based primary and dropdown navigation
- Restyled individual, family, chart, report and administration pages
- Enhanced fact and event cards with matching SVG icons
- Original themed male and female placeholder portraits
- Configurable colour palette, spacing, page width, corners and shadows
- Optional larger controls, high contrast and reduced motion settings
- Graceful styling for optional third-party history, story and book modules
- No webtrees core-file modifications

## Compatibility

- Developed for webtrees 2.2.x
- PHP requirements are the same as the installed webtrees release
- Designed for current versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari

Because third-party modules can register their own menus and markup, test the theme with your site’s module combination before using it in production.

## Installation

1. Download the release ZIP.
2. Extract it so the folder is named exactly:

   ```text
   modules_v4/potts_modern_theme/
   ```

3. In webtrees, open **Control panel → Modules → All modules**.
4. Enable **Potts Modern**.
5. Select **Potts Modern** from the Theme menu or your tree preferences.
6. Open the module settings to choose the preferred palette and layout options.
7. Clear the webtrees cache and hard-refresh the browser if an older version was previously installed.

The module is disabled by default after installation so an administrator can review it before activation.

## Upgrade

Replace the existing `potts_modern_theme` folder with the new release. The folder name remains unchanged, so saved theme preferences should be retained.

Keep a copy of the previous release until the updated theme has been tested with anonymous visitors, members, editors and administrators.

## Rollback

Select another installed theme from the Theme menu. If the web interface is unavailable, rename the module folder to:

```text
potts_modern_theme.disable
```

## Settings

The administration page provides options for:

- colour palette
- text size
- corner style
- shadows
- page and sidebar width
- content spacing
- navigation icon size and label display
- photo strip, submenu icons and event icons
- large controls
- high contrast
- reduced motion

## Optional integrations

Potts Modern includes non-essential styling for some third-party modules, including history-region selectors, stories and family-book interfaces. These integrations are optional. The theme should continue to operate when those modules are not installed.

## Known beta considerations

- The theme overrides the shared webtrees menu-item view to provide modern menu icons. Test custom modules that add unusual menu structures.
- Third-party modules may require small CSS adjustments if they use custom markup.
- The bundled `foundation.min.css` is derived from the neutral webtrees 2.2.x theme foundation and is distributed under the same GPL licence.

## Reporting problems

When reporting a problem, include:

- webtrees version
- PHP version
- browser and device
- whether the visitor was logged in
- relevant third-party modules
- a screenshot and browser-console error, where available

Add the repository’s Issues URL to `customModuleSupportUrl()` in `PottsModernTheme.php` after the GitHub repository has been created.
